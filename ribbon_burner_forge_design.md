## Bolted Assembly with Angle Iron Frame, 1.5" Air System, Sliding Firebrick Doors

## Materials Available
- 2x 1/4" x 14" x 30" steel plates
- 2x 1/4" x 12" x 14" steel plates
- 2x 1/4" x 12" x 30" steel plates
- 1/8" x 2" angle iron (quantity TBD based on needs)

## Design Overview
Horizontal box forge with bolted construction using angle iron framework. Features forced air ribbon burner with 1.5" air system and sliding firebrick doors. The bolted design allows for disassembly, modification, and easier maintenance access.

## Bolted Frame Construction Method

### Frame Assembly Strategy
Use 1/8" x 2" angle iron to create an internal corner frame system. Each corner gets a vertical angle iron piece, and plates bolt to the angle iron flanges. This creates a rigid box that can be disassembled.

### Corner Frame Pieces (Cut from 1/8" x 2" angle iron)
**Vertical Corner Posts** (4 required):
- Length: 14" each (matches forge height)
- Purpose: Creates structural corners where plates meet
- Position: One at each of 4 vertical corners

**Horizontal Edge Reinforcement** (optional but recommended):
- Top edges: 2 pieces at 30" (front and back top edges)
- Bottom edges: 2 pieces at 30" (front and back bottom edges)
- Adds rigidity to top and bottom panels

### Plate Layout with Angle Iron Frame

**Bottom Plate** (1/4" x 12" x 30"):
- Sits on four corner posts
- Bolts through plate into angle iron flanges at all four corners
- Additional bolts along edges if using edge reinforcement

**Side Plates** (1/4" x 14" x 30" each):
- Bolt to corner post flanges on both front and rear corners
- Bottom edge bolts to bottom plate's corner angles
- Top edge bolts to top plate's corner angles
- Typically 3-4 bolts per corner post (12-16 bolts per side)

**End Plates** (1/4" x 12" x 14" each):
- Bolt to corner posts on all four corners
- Top and bottom bolt to horizontal plates' corner angles
- Door openings cut in center
- 3-4 bolts per corner (12-16 bolts per end)

**Top Plate** (1/4" x 12" x 30"):
- Bolts to corner posts at all four corners
- Burner opening cut in top
- Can be fully removed for maintenance/refractory work
- Mirror of bottom plate attachment

### Bolt Specifications
- **Size**: 5/16" or 3/8" bolts recommended
- **Grade**: Grade 5 minimum (Grade 8 better)
- **Type**: Hex head bolts with flat washers and lock washers
- **Thread**: Coarse thread (easier assembly/disassembly)
- **Spacing**: 3-4" on center along angle iron
- **Clearance**: Drill holes 1/64" oversize for easy alignment

### Drilling Pattern

**Corner Posts**:
- Mark hole positions on both flanges of angle iron
- Stagger holes slightly (don't drill through apex)
- Example: First hole 1" from end, then every 3-4" along length
- 4-5 holes per flange on 14" post

**Assembly Process**:
1. Tack weld corner posts and edge angles into frame shape
2. Use this frame as drilling template for plates
3. Clamp angle to plate, mark through holes
4. Drill all plates
5. Assemble with bolts

### Corner Post Positioning Detail

**Each corner post**:
```
     |<-- Plate edge
     |
  ---+---  <- Angle iron
  |     |
  |     |  <- Other plate edge
```

Angle iron sits INSIDE the box, plates bolt to outside flanges. This keeps angle protected inside forge and provides clean exterior.

### Alternative: External Frame
If preferred, angle iron can be mounted OUTSIDE:
- Plates butt together at corners
- Angle iron overlays joint on outside
- Bolts pass through angle → plate → plate → nut inside
- Creates exposed framework (industrial look)
- Slightly easier assembly

**Recommended**: Internal frame (cleaner, protects angle from heat)

## Assembled Forge Dimensions

### External Dimensions
- Width: 12" (bottom/top plates)
- Height: 14" (end plates)  
- Length: 30" (side plates)
- Plus ~1/4" for plate thickness overlap

### Internal Dimensions
- Before lining: ~11.5" W x 13.5" H x 29.5" L
- After 2" lining: ~7.5" W x 9.5" H x 25.5" L

### Door Openings
**Front End** (12" x 14" plate):
- Opening: 9" W x 11" H (centered)
- Border: 1.5" on all sides
- Avoid drilling bolt holes in door opening area

**Rear End** (12" x 14" plate):
- Opening: 7" W x 9" H (centered)
- Border: 2.5" on all sides
- Allows pass-through for long stock

## Ribbon Burner Design (1.5" Air System)

### Burner Head Specifications
- **Housing**: 3" x 3" square steel tubing, 12" long
- **Air inlet**: 1.5" diameter pipe, 6" stub
- **Refractory head**: 3" deep cast refractory
- **Flame holes**: 24 holes, 1/4" diameter, staggered pattern
- **Mounting**: Top-mounted, 30-45° downward angle

### Burner Construction

**Components**:
1. 3" x 3" square tube, 12" long
2. 1.5" pipe stub, 6" long (air inlet)
3. Baffle plate (1/8" steel, 2.75" x 2.75")
4. 1/4" pipe, 6" long (gas injection)
5. Castable refractory, 5-8 lbs

**Assembly Steps**:
1. **Air inlet**: Drill 1.5" hole centered on one end of square tube, weld 1.5" pipe stub
2. **Gas injection**: Drill 1/4" hole in side of 1.5" pipe (2" from square tube), insert/weld 1/4" pipe pointing downstream
3. **Baffle plate**: Cut 2.75" x 2.75" from 1/8" steel, create mixing pattern (cut triangular notches or bent tabs), tack weld inside square tube 3-4" from open face
4. **Cast refractory head**: 
   - Build mold box around open face
   - Insert 24 straws in pattern (3 rows of 8, staggered)
   - Mix and pour castable refractory, 3" deep
   - Cure 24-48 hours, remove straws
   - Oven cure at 200-250°F for 4-6 hours

**Hole Pattern** (looking at burner face):
```
Row 1: O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O  (8 holes, 1.5" centers)
Row 2:  O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O (8 holes, offset 0.75")
Row 3: O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O  (8 holes, 1.5" centers)
```
Vertical spacing: 1" between rows

### Burner Mounting in Top Plate

**Mounting Method Using Angle Iron**:
1. Cut 3.5" x 12.5" rectangular opening in top plate
2. Position 10" from front end, centered side-to-side
3. Cut four pieces of 1/8" x 2" angle iron to create mounting frame:
   - 2 pieces at 14" (runs perpendicular to opening)
   - 2 pieces at 4" (runs parallel to opening)
4. Weld or bolt angle iron around opening to create angled bracket
5. Burner sits on angled frame at 30-45° angle
6. Drill mounting holes through square tube and angle bracket
7. Bolt burner in place (allows removal for service)
8. Seal perimeter with refractory cement

**Angle Options**:
- 30°: Gentler angle, flame travels farther before hitting floor
- 45°: Steeper angle, more direct heat to chamber floor
- Recommended: 30-40° for best heat distribution

## Round Rod Sliding Firebrick Door System

### Front Door Assembly (Main Access)

**Round Rod Track System**:

**Mounting rod** (1/2" diameter round steel rod):
- Length: 24-26" (extends 12" beyond opening to each side)
- Position: Welded horizontally 2" above door opening
- Rod supports: Two small brackets welded to forge face at rod ends
- Smooth rod surface (deburred, can apply anti-seize for smoother sliding)

**Door Panel Construction**:

1. **Steel frame** (welded):
   - Face plate: 1/8" steel, 10" W x 12" H
   - Side edges: 1/8" steel strips, 3" deep x 12" tall (left and right)
   - Top/bottom edges: 1/8" steel strips, 3" deep x 10" wide
   - Creates box with open back, 10" x 12" x 3" deep

2. **Rod hanger/clamp** (top of door):
   - Use 1/2" pipe clamp, conduit hanger, or fabricated tube
   - Weld clamp to top center of door frame
   - Clamp slides freely on 1/2" rod
   - Add connecting bracket from clamp to door top
   - Door hangs from rod, weight helps create seal against opening

3. **Firebrick insert**:
   - Standard IFB: 9" x 4.5" x 2.5" (typical size)
   - Stack arrangement: 2 wide x 2 tall = 9" x 9" (plus one half brick on top for 11" height)
   - Or: 2 wide x 2.5 tall = 9" x 11.25" (trim to 11")
   - Bricks sit inside steel frame, facing forge
   - 1/2" clearance around bricks (thermal expansion)
   - Secure with ceramic fiber paper packing or high-temp adhesive

4. **Handle**:
   - 1/2" steel rod, 6-8" long
   - Weld to outer side of door frame
   - Extends perpendicular from door face
   - Stays cool enough to grab (distance from heat)

**Operation**:
- Pull handle to slide door horizontally (left or right)
- Door hangs from rod, slides smoothly
- Fully closed: firebrick face covers opening, weight creates seal
- Partially open: 2-6" opening for tool access
- Fully open: door slides completely to side, clears opening

**Advantages of Round Rod Design**:
- Simpler construction (one rod vs. two angle iron tracks)
- Smoother sliding action
- Self-aligning (gravity keeps door vertical)
- Less parts, easier to maintain
- Door weight provides sealing pressure against opening

### Rear Door Assembly (Pass-Through)

**Smaller version using same round rod system**:
- Opening: 7" W x 9" H
- Rod: 1/2" diameter, 18-20" long
- Door frame: 8" W x 10" H x 3" D
- Firebrick: 2 bricks stacked (7" x 9")
- Same rod hanger/clamp system
- Same construction method as front door

**Can slide same direction as front OR opposite** depending on stand layout and preference.

## Refractory Lining System

### Materials
- Ceramic fiber blanket: 2" thick, ~15 sq ft
- IFB (Insulating Fire Brick): 16-20 for floor, 10-12 for doors
- Rigidizer: 1-2 quarts
- IR reflective coating (optional): 1 pint
- Stainless steel pins/staples: 50-100
- Refractory cement: 1 quart

### Installation

**Floor**:
- Stack IFB flat (2.5" thick)
- Cut to fit 12" x 30" footprint
- Removable for flux cleanup/replacement

**Walls and Ceiling**:
- Cut ceramic blanket to size
- Pin through steel plates (drill small holes, insert pins, bend inside)
- Apply rigidizer (2-3 coats)
- Optional: Apply IR coating for efficiency

**Around Doors**:
- Line around openings with blanket
- Secure well (high wear area)
- Trim flush with opening edges

### Final Internal Dimensions
- Width: ~7.5" (working chamber)
- Height: ~9"
- Length: ~25.5"

## Air Supply System (1.5" Piping)

### Blower
- **Type**: Centrifugal forge blower
- **CFM**: 120-150 minimum
- **Speed control**: Variable (ceiling fan controller)

### Plumbing (1.5" throughout)
1. Blower outlet (may need 2" to 1.5" reducer)
2. Flexible hose: 1.5" silicone, 12-18" (vibration isolation)
3. Main line: 1.5" black pipe
4. Gate valve: 1.5" (air adjustment)
5. Connection to burner: 1.5" pipe to burner inlet
6. Keep total length under 6 feet

### Why 1.5" Works
- Adequate CFM for this forge size
- Higher velocity aids gas/air mixing
- Lighter, cheaper fittings
- Easier to source
- Blower may run at higher % speed than 2" system

## Gas System (Propane)

### Components (in order from tank)
1. Propane tank (20-100 lb)
2. Adjustable regulator (0-30 PSI)
3. Pressure gauge (0-15 PSI)
4. Main ball valve (1/4")
5. Solenoid valve (1/4", optional)
6. Needle valve (1/4", fine adjustment)
7. Gas injection into 1.5" air inlet

### Piping
- 1/4" black iron pipe or propane hose
- Gas-rated thread sealant
- Leak test all connections with soapy water

## Forge Stand with Door Track Extensions

### Stand Frame
- **Material**: 2" square tubing (or use 1/8" x 2" angle iron)
- **Height**: 32-36" working height
- **Footprint**: 36" L x 20" W (wider to support door tracks)
- **Top frame**: Matches forge footprint, bolts to forge bottom plate

### Door Track Support Extensions
- **Front**: Extend stand 14-16" to left or right (direction doors slide)
- **Rear**: Extend stand 10-12" same direction
- These extensions support the sliding tracks beyond forge body
- Ensures rigid track mounting (no flex during door operation)
- Can use same 1/8" x 2" angle iron as forge frame

### Stand to Forge Mounting
- Forge bottom plate bolts to stand top frame
- Use 3/8" bolts, 4-6 attachment points
- Allows forge removal for maintenance
- Easy to level with shims if needed

## Operation Guide

### Startup Procedure
1. Slide doors open
2. Open air gate valve fully
3. Start blower, wait 10-15 seconds
4. Open gas main valve
5. Slowly open needle valve
6. Ignite at door opening with long lighter
7. Adjust gas for desired heat
8. Close doors to desired position
9. Fine-tune air/gas ratio

### Using Sliding Doors

**Closed** (heat retention):
- Both doors fully closed
- Maximum temperature
- For soaking work

**Partially open** (working):
- Front door 2-4" open
- Tool access while maintaining heat
- Good for most forging

**Fully open** (access):
- Front door slid completely to side
- Loading/unloading stock
- Visual inspection

**Pass-through** (long stock):
- Both doors open
- Allows bars longer than 25" to extend through

### Tuning Flame

**Neutral** (general forging):
- Purple-blue flame with orange streaks
- Minimal scale on steel
- Balance air and gas

**Reducing** (forge welding):
- More orange/yellow flame
- Reduce air, increase gas
- Prevents oxidation

**Oxidizing** (maximum heat):
- Bright blue flame
- Increase air
- Not ideal for most work (causes heavy scale)

### Shutdown
1. Close gas needle valve
2. Keep blower running 60 seconds (purge)
3. Turn off blower
4. Allow to cool before fully closing doors
5. Never move forge while hot

## Bolted Assembly Advantages

### Maintenance Access
- Remove top plate for full access to chamber
- Replace refractory without cutting/grinding
- Service burner by unbolting
- Replace damaged plates individually

### Modifications
- Easy to add ports, vents, or additional burners
- Can resize or reconfigure later
- Upgrade components without full rebuild

### Transport
- Can disassemble for moving
- Transport in pieces (lighter, easier)
- Reassemble at new location

### Initial Build
- No welding of main body required (though welding door frames recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### Bolted Assembly Issues

**Forge not square**:
- Loosen all bolts
- Square with framing square
- Tighten opposite corners alternately

**Bolts loosening**:
- Use lock washers or Loctite
- Check after first few heat cycles
- May need to re-torque periodically

**Air leaks at joints**:
- High-temp gasket maker on joints
- Or accept minor leaks (usually not critical)

**Plates warping**:
- 1/4" thick should resist warping
- Ensure refractory fully installed (insulation)
- May need to loosen/re-torque bolts after initial burns

### Door Issues

**Door binding**:
- Check track parallel
- Clean scale from tracks
- Adjust track spacing

**Firebrick falling out**:
- Tighten frame
- Add cross-support
- Use high-temp adhesive

**Door too heavy to slide**:
- Add small roller wheels to top edge
- Check track angle (slight downward toward closed helps)

### Forge Performance

**Not hot enough**:
- Close doors more
- Increase gas pressure
- Check for air leaks in body
- Verify adequate blower CFM

**Uneven heating**:
- Adjust burner angle
- Check all 24 holes clear
- Increase gas, balance air

**Excessive fuel consumption**:
- Gas leaks (find and fix)
- Poor refractory (cracks/gaps)
- Doors open too wide

## Final Design Summary

This bolted forge design provides:
- **Flexibility**: Easy disassembly for maintenance, transport, modifications
- **Durability**: 1/4" steel plates with angle iron reinforcement
- **Performance**: Ribbon burner with 1.5" air for even, efficient heating
- **Convenience**: Sliding firebrick doors for superior control
- **Accessibility**: You have the primary materials (plates and angle iron)
- **Buildability**: Straightforward construction with common tools

The combination of bolted assembly and angle iron framing creates a professional-grade forge that can be built without specialized welding equipment (except for door frames, which could be bolted if preferred). The design balances performance, practicality, and ease of construction.
